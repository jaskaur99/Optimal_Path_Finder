# Project README

## Overview
This project aims to assist the local police department in minimizing the installation of security cameras at traffic intersections by solving the Vertex Cover problem. The implementation is divided into multiple assignments, each building upon the previous one to achieve the desired functionality efficiently.

## Assignments Overview
### A1
- **Languages**: Python, C++
- **Tools**: Multithreading, CMake, MiniSAT, Linux, Multiprocessing
- **Sample Input**: Specifies commands to add, change, remove streets and generate a graph.
- **Sample Output**: Displays the corresponding graph vertices and edges.

### A2
- **Objective**: Create a program that takes input, specifies a graph, and outputs shortest paths.
- **Sample Input**: Graph specifications and shortest path queries.
- **Sample Output**: Shortest paths between specified vertices.

### A3
- **Objective**: Generate random input for A1, manage IPC between A1 and A2, and output graph specification.
- **Components**: Random input generator, Python script, C++ program.
- **Sample Output**: Graph specifications and shortest paths.

### A4
- **Objective**: Solve the minimal Vertex Cover problem using various approaches and measure their efficiency.
- **Tools**: MiniSAT SAT solver, Multithreading
- **Approaches**:
  - Reduction of VERTEX COVER to CNF-SAT
  - Approximation algorithms: APPROX-VC-1 and APPROX-VC-2
- **Input**: Graph specifications generated by graphGen.
- **Output**: Computed vertex covers by each approach.
